                <p>
                    There are many benefits to seeing a periodontist for treating and maintaining your oral health. A periodontist is a dentist who specializes in preventing, diagnosing, and treating periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is a progressive bacterial infection that destroys the gum tissue and bone supporting the teeth. If left untreated, it can lead to tooth loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A periodontist can provide a comprehensive treatment plan to help you manage your oral health and prevent further damage to your gums and teeth. They can also offer guidance on how to keep your mouth healthy and free of bacteria. Seeing a periodontist for regular cleanings and checkups is essential to maintaining good oral health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have been diagnosed with periodontal disease, a periodontist can work with you to create a treatment plan that is right for you. Treatment options vary depending on the severity of your condition and may include scaling and root planing, antibiotics, surgery, or a combination of these methods. A periodontist can also guide you on how to care for your mouth after treatment to help reduce the risk of recurrence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Periodontics is an essential field of dentistry, and seeing a periodontist can help you maintain good oral health. Please contact our office today if you have any questions about periodontics or would like to schedule an appointment.

                    WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST COMMON PROCEDURES PERFORMED BY A PERIODONTIST?

                <p>
                    A periodontist’s most common procedures include scaling and root planing, gingival flap surgery, and bone grafting. Scaling and root planing is a non-surgical procedure where the tartar and plaque buildup is removed from the teeth and roots. Gingival flap surgery is a surgical procedure where the gums are lifted back to access the teeth and roots. Bone grafting is a procedure where the bone is transplanted to an area of the jaw with bone loss. These are just a few of the many strategies that a periodontist can perform. If you think you may need any of these procedures, be sure to consult with your dentist or periodontist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practicing good oral hygiene is the most important thing you can do for your oral health. This means brushing your teeth twice daily, flossing daily, and visiting your dentist or periodontist regularly. Ask your dentist or periodontist if you have any questions about periodontics or how to take care of your teeth. They will be happy to help you keep your smile healthy and beautiful.

When pregnant, it is essential to maintain good oral hygiene and visit your dentist regularly. People with diabetes are also at increased risk for developing periodontal disease. Reasonable blood sugar control can help reduce the risk of periodontal disease.
